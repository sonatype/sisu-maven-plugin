============
As required by the Eclipse IP process, all contributions need to be submitted in form of patches attached to a
[Bugzilla entry](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Sisu), thereby being subject to the
[Eclipse Terms of Use](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/termsofuse.php). For clarity, patches should be provided as
standalone files attached to the issue, not as text embedded in the issue description or a comment.

When submitting patches, please follow the existing code style. The corresponding formatter settings for some IDEs can
be taken from the [Maven Code Style](http://maven.apache.org/developers/committer-environment.html#Maven_Code_Style)
page.
